e) Compile time will be shoptened on bigger project as you won't have to compile the whole project, just your individual branch
   Every time you need to test or debug
   There is less of a chance of corruption of the master branch as users will only be working on their own specific branches.

f) Git status is used to show the current status of the repository as it exists within your directory as compared to the master or branch.
   Git log is used to show past changes to the master or branch, not the current status. 

g) git log -p Weapon.h

h) git log --grep="file"

i) Inheritance allows a child class to take on the properties of its parent class while still being a seperate class on its own definied by its 
   own specific paramaters
   Polymorphism allows for classes to be converted into others for method sakes. It is the ability to trate objects of different types in a similiar manner.
   Encapsulation is a method for restricitng the objects direct components eg the public vs private methods.
